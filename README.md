# Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for vSphere

This repository provides tools and scripts for building and testing the vSphere CSI provider. This driver is in a stable `GA` state and is suitable for production use. Some of the features may be in the `beta` phase. Please refer [feature matrix](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere-Container-Storage-Plug-in/2.0/vmware-vsphere-csp-getting-started/GUID-E59B13F5-6F49-4619-9877-DF710C365A1E.html) for more details.  vSphere CSI driver requires vSphere 6.7 U3 or higher in order to operate.

The CSI driver, when used on Kubernetes, also requires the use of the out-of-tree vSphere Cloud Provider Interface [CPI](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere).
